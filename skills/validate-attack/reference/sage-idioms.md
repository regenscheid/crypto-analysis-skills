# Sage idioms for cryptanalysis

Layer 3 of `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Organised by **task**, not by API surface — the
failure this addresses is not "doesn't know `GroebnerBasis`", it is not knowing
how to set a problem up so the tool answers the question you meant.

## The rule for this file

> **Every snippet here was executed and its real output captured. Nothing is
> written from memory.**

`docs/ROADMAP.md` names this file as **the single largest hallucination risk in
the plan**: plausible, subtly wrong Sage laundered into confident output. So
each entry shows what it actually printed on this machine. If you add an entry,
run it first.

**Stack** — `SageMath 10.7`, `Python 3.11.15`, the Claude Science `sage` env.
There are two SageMaths on this machine and they are not the same one; see
`docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md`. Print provenance with results:

```python
version(); import sys; sys.version_info[:3]
# ('sage', '10.7', 'python', '3.11.15')
```

## Rings and fields

### Finite field with a primitive generator
```python
F = GF(2**8, 'a', modulus='primitive')
a = F.gen()
(F.order(), F.characteristic(), F.degree(), a.multiplicative_order())
# (256, 2, 8, 255)
```
`modulus='primitive'` matters — the default modulus need not make `a` a
multiplicative generator, and code that assumes it will be subtly wrong.

### Cyclotomic field and its ring of integers
```python
K = CyclotomicField(256)
OK = K.ring_of_integers()
(K.degree(), K.discriminant().nbits(), OK.rank())
# (128, 897, 128)
```
Note **degree 128, not 256** — φ(256) = 128. Off-by-a-factor-of-two here is a
classic error in module-lattice work.

### The NTRU/ML-KEM quotient ring
```python
n, q = 256, 3329
R = PolynomialRing(GF(q), 'x'); x = R.gen()
Rq = R.quotient(x**n + 1, 'xb')
f = Rq([1] + [0]*(n-2) + [1])
(f*f).lift().degree()
# 255
```

### How x^n + 1 splits — the NTT structure
```python
n, q = 256, 3329
R = PolynomialRing(GF(q), 'x')
fac = (R.gen()**n + 1).factor()
(len(fac), sorted(set(g.degree() for g,_ in fac)))
# (128, [2])
```
**x²⁵⁶ + 1 splits into 128 factors of degree 2 mod 3329 — not 256 linear
factors.** That is exactly why ML-KEM's NTT is *incomplete*, bottoming out at
degree-2 polynomials with pointwise multiplication in F_q[x]/(x²−ζ). Any analysis
assuming a fully-splitting ring is analysing a different scheme. Check this
before assuming, for every (n, q) pair.

## Lattices

### ⚠ Do not demonstrate LLL on a random square integer matrix
```python
set_random_seed(1)
M = random_matrix(ZZ, 40, 40, x=-50, y=50)
min(M.row(i).norm() for i in range(40))   # 138.824
min(M.LLL().row(i).norm() for i in range(40))            # 138.824
min(M.BKZ(block_size=20).row(i).norm() for i in range(40))  # 138.824
```
**The bases differ (`M == M.LLL()` is False) but the shortest vector is
identical.** A generic random lattice has no short vector to find, so reduction
correctly achieves nothing. Benchmarking or sanity-checking a reduction routine
this way will tell you it does not work.

### LLL on a q-ary lattice — where there *is* something to find
```python
set_random_seed(11)
n, m, q = 10, 20, 1021
A = random_matrix(GF(q), n, m)
L0 = A.change_ring(ZZ).stack(q*identity_matrix(ZZ, m))    # 30 x 20
before = min(L0.row(i).norm() for i in range(L0.nrows()) if L0.row(i).norm() > 0)
after  = min(L0.LLL().row(i).norm() for i in range(L0.nrows()) if L0.LLL().row(i).norm() > 0)
(before, after)
# 1021.00 -> 35.68   (28.6x)
```
This is the shape LWE and SIS actually produce. Use it as the smoke test.

### fpylll directly, with a BKZ 2.0 tour
```python
from fpylll import IntegerMatrix, LLL as fLLL, BKZ as fBKZ
A = IntegerMatrix.random(50, "qary", k=25, bits=20)
fLLL.reduction(A)
before = A[0].norm()                       # 1857.7
par = fBKZ.Param(block_size=20, strategies=fBKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY)
fBKZ.reduction(A, par)
(before, A[0].norm())
# (1857.7, 1815.28)
```
`strategies=fBKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY` is not optional in practice — without a
strategy the preprocessing is unspecified and timings are not comparable.

### The Gram–Schmidt profile (what a BKZ shape claim is about)
```python
from fpylll import IntegerMatrix, GSO, LLL as fLLL
A = IntegerMatrix.random(30, "qary", k=15, bits=15)
fLLL.reduction(A)
M = GSO.Mat(A); M.update_gso()
[round(M.get_r(i,i)**0.5, 2) for i in range(5)]
# [293.27, 279.48, 259.25, 260.43, 238.49]
```
`get_r(i,i)` is the **squared** norm — take the root. The decreasing profile is
the thing GSA and BKZ-simulator claims are about; plot it before trusting a
predicted β.

### Babai nearest-plane (CVP)
```python
from fpylll import IntegerMatrix, LLL as fLLL, GSO
A = IntegerMatrix.random(20, "qary", k=10, bits=10)
fLLL.reduction(A); M = GSO.Mat(A); M.update_gso()
M.babai([1]*20)[:5]
# (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```
An all-zero answer is correct here — the target is nearer the origin than any
basis vector — and is a reminder to choose a target that exercises the routine.

## Multivariate

### A system over F_q with an explicit monomial order
```python
q, nv = 16, 6
F = GF(q, 'a')
R = PolynomialRing(F, nv, 'x', order='degrevlex')
(R.term_order().name(), len(polys), polys[0].degree())
# ('degrevlex', 6, 2)
```
**Always set `order` explicitly.** `degrevlex` is what Gröbner solvers are fast
in and what degree-of-regularity arguments assume; `lex` is far slower and the
default is not guaranteed to be what you want.

### Gröbner basis, and the degrees actually reached
```python
R = PolynomialRing(GF(7), 3, 'x', order='degrevlex')
x,y,z = R.gens()
I = R.ideal([x*y - 1, y*z - 1, x + y + z])
G = I.groebner_basis()
(len(G), [g.degree() for g in G], I.dimension())
# (3, [2, 1, 1], 0)
```
`I.dimension() == 0` confirms finitely many solutions — check it before quoting
a solving complexity that assumes a zero-dimensional ideal.

### Degree of regularity from the semi-regular Hilbert series
```python
m, n = 20, 10            # m equations, n variables
Rt.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, default_prec=30)
coeffs = ((1-t**2)**m / (1-t)**n).O(30).list()
dreg = next(i for i,c in enumerate(coeffs) if c <= 0)
(dreg, coeffs[:8])
# (4, [1, 10, 35, 20, -195, -498, 15, 1800])
```
**This is the semi-regular *estimate*, not a measurement of your system.** It is
what `MQEstimator` assumes. A real system may not be semi-regular, and
confirming that requires actually computing the basis — see the Magma note in
the `analyze-scheme` skill's `reference/multivariate.md`. If m ≤ n the series has no
non-positive coefficient and `next()` raises `StopIteration`; that is the
computation telling you the system is underdetermined, not a bug.

### Macaulay matrix at a fixed degree
```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement
R = PolynomialRing(GF(7), 3, 'x', order='degrevlex'); xs = R.gens()
polys = [xs[0]*xs[1] - 1, xs[1]*xs[2] - 1, xs[0] + xs[1] + xs[2]]
D = 3
mons = [prod(c) for c in combinations_with_replacement(xs, D)]
rows = [[ (f*mlt).monomial_coefficient(mm) for mm in mons ]
        for f in polys
        for mlt in [prod(c) for c in combinations_with_replacement(xs, D - f.degree())]]
Mac = matrix(GF(7), rows)
(Mac.dimensions(), Mac.rank())
# ((12, 10), 9)
```
Rank deficiency (9 < 10) is the quantity XL-family complexity arguments turn on.

---

## Linear algebra and MinRank

### Rank and kernel over F_q
```python
F = GF(16,'a'); set_random_seed(4)
Ms = [random_matrix(F, 5, 5) for _ in range(4)]
target = sum(l*M for l,M in zip([F.random_element() for _ in range(4)], Ms))
(target.rank(), target.right_kernel().dimension(), len(Ms))
# (5, 0, 4)
```
A random combination is full rank — which is the point: **MinRank is hard
because low rank is rare.**

### Planting a low-rank matrix deliberately
```python
F = GF(16,'a'); set_random_seed(5)
U = random_matrix(F, 5, 2); V = random_matrix(F, 2, 5)
(U*V).rank()
# 2
```
The UV factorisation is how you build a MinRank instance with known solution —
the basis of any `validate-attack` ladder for Rainbow-style breaks.

---

## Coding

```python
C = codes.HammingCode(GF(2), 4)
H = C.parity_check_matrix()
v = C.random_element()
e = vector(GF(2), [1] + [0]*(C.length()-1))
(C.length(), C.dimension(), C.minimum_distance(), list(H*(v+e)))
# (15, 11, 3, [1, 0, 0, 0])
```
The syndrome of a weight-1 error is the corresponding column of H — the check
that your H orientation is right before building a decoder.

```python
set_random_seed(6)
C = codes.LinearCode(random_matrix(GF(2), 6, 12))
(C.length(), C.dimension(), C.parity_check_matrix().dimensions())
# (12, 6, (6, 12))
```

---

## Sampling

### Discrete Gaussian over the integers
```python
from sage.stats.distributions.discrete_gaussian_integer import \
    DiscreteGaussianDistributionIntegerSampler
Dg = DiscreteGaussianDistributionIntegerSampler(sigma=3.2)
set_random_seed(8)
xs = [Dg() for _ in range(20000)]
(min(xs), max(xs), float(sum(xs))/len(xs))
# (-12, 15, -0.0086)
```
**Do not name the sampler `D`** — Sage exports `D` as a derivative operator, and
`D()` then fails with `TypeError: 'DerivativeOperator' object is not callable`.
Encountered while writing this file.

### Centred binomial (ML-KEM's noise)
```python
import random as _pyrandom          # NOT `import random`
rng = _pyrandom.Random(7)
def cbd(eta, rng):
    return sum(rng.randint(0,1) for _ in range(eta)) - sum(rng.randint(0,1) for _ in range(eta))
```
**Name collision.** `from sage.all import *` shadows `random`, and the Sage
version rejects the seed with `TypeError: The only supported seed types are:
None, int, float, str, bytes, and bytearray`. Import under an alias. *(This
snippet is the one entry here whose output is not captured — it failed in the
harness for exactly this reason and the alias fix is untested. Marked rather
than implied.)*

---

## Symmetric

### S-box criteria
```python
import sage.crypto.sbox
S = sage.crypto.sbox.SBox([0xC,5,6,0xB,9,0,0xA,0xD,3,0xE,0xF,8,4,7,1,2])  # PRESENT
(S.differential_uniformity(), S.linearity(), S.max_degree(),
 S.differential_branch_number(), S.linear_branch_number())
# (4, 8, 3, 3, 2)
```
These are PRESENT's published values — use them as the self-test that your S-box
is entered correctly before analysing an unfamiliar one. `.difference_distribution_table()`
and `.linear_approximation_table()` give the full DDT/LAT.

### Boolean functions
```python
from sage.crypto.boolean_function import BooleanFunction
B = BooleanFunction([0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1])
(B.nvariables(), str(B.algebraic_normal_form()), B.nonlinearity(), B.algebraic_immunity())
# (3, 'x0 + x1 + x2', 0, 1)
```
Nonlinearity 0 because this truth table *is* affine — a useful degenerate check.

### MILP: the trail-search skeleton
```python
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=False, solver='GLPK')
x = p.new_variable(binary=True)
for r in range(4):
    p.add_constraint(sum(x[r,i] for i in range(4)) >= 1)
for r in range(3):
    p.add_constraint(sum(x[r,i] for i in range(4)) + sum(x[r+1,i] for i in range(4)) >= 3)
p.set_objective(sum(x[r,i] for r in range(4) for i in range(4)))
p.solve()
# 6.0
```
This is the shape of a differential/linear active-S-box count: binary activity
variables, per-round activity constraints, a diffusion constraint linking rounds,
minimise the total. **Use `solver='SCIP'`** — GLPK is the default and too weak
for a real cipher. SCIP returns 6.0 on this toy instance, agreeing with GLPK,
which is the cross-check you want before trusting it on something larger.

### SAT, with XOR clauses
```python
from sage.sat.solvers import CryptoMiniSat
s = CryptoMiniSat()
s.add_clause((1,2,3)); s.add_clause((-1,)); s.add_clause((-2,))
sol = s()                      # True, sol[3] is True

s2 = CryptoMiniSat()
s2.add_xor_clause((1,2,3), rhs=True)   # native XOR -- accepted, solves
```
**`add_xor_clause` is why CryptoMiniSat rather than a generic solver.** Linear
and differential relations over GF(2) *are* XOR constraints; encoding them as
CNF blows up, and CryptoMiniSat handles them natively.

Historical note worth keeping: this section originally read "SAT is NOT
available", because all five of Sage's backends failed — the wrapper class
imports fine without the underlying module. **Importing a solver class proves
nothing; instantiate and solve.** `pycryptosat` was installed 2026-08-01.

---

## Parallelism

### Pool over independent trials — and the crossover, measured

Monte Carlo over seeds is embarrassingly parallel. Whether it is *worth*
parallelising is a different question, and the answer is not "always":

```python
import os
os.environ["OMP_NUM_THREADS"] = "1"      # BEFORE numpy is imported
import numpy as np, time
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

def trial(rep):                           # seed FROM THE INDEX, never shared
    rng = np.random.default_rng(400000 + rep)
    x = rng.standard_normal(200000)
    return float(x.mean()), float(x.std())

if __name__ == "__main__":                # REQUIRED on macOS -- see below
    REPS = 24
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as ex:
        pooled = list(ex.map(trial, range(REPS)))
```

Measured on this machine, 24 trials, 8 workers, against the identical serial
loop. Speedup depends entirely on what ONE trial costs:

```
per-trial cost      serial    pooled(8)   speedup
~2 ms                0.04s      0.17s       0.3x    <- POOLING LOSES
~20 ms               0.46s      0.21s       2.1x
~230 ms              5.61s      0.92s       6.1x
~2.6 s              61.78s      8.33s       7.4x
```

`pooled == serial` exactly at every size, because each trial seeds from its own
index.

**The crossover is around 20 ms per trial.** Below it the pool costs more than
the work — process spawn is ~20 ms each. 94% of this workbench's runs finish in
under ten seconds *in total*, so most of them should not be pooled at all.
**Time one trial before reaching for a pool**; `investigate`'s compute route
carries the rule.

### ⚠ `if __name__ == "__main__":` is mandatory, not style

macOS spawns child processes rather than forking, so each child **re-imports the
module**. Without the guard, module-level pool creation runs again in every
child, recursively. Omitting it produced pages of

```
File ".../multiprocessing/spawn.py", line 122, in spawn_main
```

and no result. Encountered while writing this entry.

### Seed from the loop index, never from a shared generator

```python
def trial(rep):
    rng = np.random.default_rng(BASE + rep)   # right: independent by construction
```

A single module-level `rng` shared across workers is the classic error, and its
symptom is *statistical* rather than a crash: samples that are not independent,
giving tighter error bars and more confident p-values than the data supports.

**Stated as a rule, not as a measurement.** A shared-generator demo written for
this entry did *not* reproduce the collision predicted — 8 of 8 values came back
distinct — because the outcome depends on the start method and on how `map`
chunks work across workers. The rule stands on how RNG state works; the failure
mode was not characterised here, so do not cite this file as having shown it.

### What does not parallelise

One Gröbner basis, one lattice reduction, one SVP enumeration, one
`class_number()` — each is a single sequential algorithm and splits not at all.
Pooling helps only *across* independent instances. Four workers on four
intractable instances is still intractable: on 2026-08-06 an enumeration grid ran
to dimension 128 and could never have finished at any width. **Bound the problem
before widening it.**

## Pitfalls this file exists to record

Every one encountered while building it, none from memory:

| Pitfall | Symptom |
|---|---|
| `from sage.all import *` shadows `random`, `round`, `D` | `TypeError` on seeding; Sage types leaking into `json.dump`; `'DerivativeOperator' object is not callable` |
| `exec` with separate globals/locals dicts | comprehensions raise `NameError` on names defined in the same snippet — pass **one** dict |
| Running a `.py` under `sage` | no preparser, so `Rt.<t> = ...` is a syntax error; `from sage.repl.preparse import preparse` and wrap |
| Random square integer matrix as an LLL demo | reduction appears to do nothing, because there is nothing to find |
| Importing a SAT class | proves the class exists, not that a solver is installed — this one bit, see the SAT entry |
| `M.get_r(i,i)` from fpylll | is the **squared** norm |
| `CyclotomicField(256)` | has degree **128** |

## Verification status

**22 of 24 snippets executed clean** on this machine and their captured output
appears above verbatim. Two did not, and both are marked in place: the
centred-binomial entry (name collision; the alias fix is written but untested)
and the SAT entry (no solver installed — that failure is itself the finding).
