# Reproduction and Falsification Planner

## Use this skill when

A claim depends on computation, simulation, solver output, undocumented code, probabilistic evidence, or an attack transfer. Use it to turn “try this” into a smallest decisive and independently repeatable test.

## Operating procedure

1. **State the claim and falsifier.** Write one sentence for the claimed effect and one observable outcome that would falsify or materially weaken it.
2. **Freeze artifacts.** Record spec version, code commit, patches, compiler/interpreter, dependencies, solver/version/options, hardware-relevant settings, and input-generation rules.
3. **Create an independent reference path.** Prefer a second implementation, high-precision computation, exhaustive small instance, symbolic check, or direct simulation that does not share the same likely bug.
4. **Stage the experiment.** Start with hand-checkable vectors and toy/reduced instances; then exhaustive reduced searches; then statistically powered full experiments. Stop when a cheaper stage decisively refutes the claim.
5. **Instrument intermediate values.** Record round states, differences/masks, carries, key-schedule values, constraints, solver witnesses, counters, and filtering stages so failures can be localized.
6. **Use controls.** Include known-positive examples, known-negative examples, randomized/null instances, wrong-key samples, deliberately broken encodings, and boundary cases.
7. **Plan statistics before sampling.** Define test statistic, null/alternative, sample size or sequential stopping rule, confidence interval, multiple-testing correction, and treatment of zero events. Preserve raw counts and seeds.
8. **Validate solver claims.** Check witnesses directly in the primitive. For infeasibility, require a proof/certificate where available or independent encodings and exhaustive small-case comparison. A timeout proves nothing.
9. **Package reproducibly.** Include commands, locked dependencies, deterministic seeds, generated-data manifest, expected outputs, logs, checksums, plots from raw data, and machine-readable results.
10. **Assign status.** Use hypothesis, partially supported, reproduced, independently verified, refuted, superseded, or inconclusive. Explain exactly what remains untested.

## Output contract

Fill `assets/REPRODUCTION_MANIFEST.yaml` and produce:

- prioritized tests from cheapest/most decisive to most expensive;
- explicit positive, negative, and null controls;
- sample-size and statistical analysis plan;
- independent validation route;
- commands and expected outputs;
- raw-data and artifact layout;
- falsification conditions and stop rules;
- final validation status with limitations.

## Non-negotiable guardrails

- Bind every statement to the exact target artifact, version, parameters, round/phase scope, and adversary model.
- Label a result accurately as a property, trail, differential/linear hull, distinguisher, recovery attack, forgery, collision, proof gap, or implementation failure.
- Never describe a reduced-round, weak-key, related-key, nonce-misuse, chosen-ciphertext, Q2, or component-only result as a full-scheme break without the corresponding full-scheme model.
- Recompute data, time, memory, preprocessing, communication, verification, and success probability; do not copy headline exponents without their units and assumptions.
- Preserve contradictory evidence, failed reproductions, corrections, and source-version chronology.
- Treat solver timeout, bounded search failure, and absence of a known attack as inconclusive—not as evidence of security.
- Mark every inference that is not directly established by a proof, derivation, experiment, or cited source.
