# Security definitions, as checkable obligations

Layer 3 of `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Ships with `analyze-paper`, which runs
[`mismatches.md`](mismatches.md) as its checklist. Also consulted by
`verify-claim` when a claim turns on a notion being met, and by `analyze-scheme`
for the NIST category ladder.

Split by primitive so an analysis loads what it needs. A KEM review should not
have to read the seven hash notions to find its own obligations.

| file | covers |
|---|---|
| [`conventions.md`](conventions.md) | Advantage conventions, concrete vs asymptotic, query budgets, and the standard/ROM/QROM distinction. **Cross-cutting — read with any of the below.** |
| [`pke-kem.md`](pke-kem.md) | IND-CPA, IND-CCA1/CCA2, KEM IND-CCA (stated separately — it is not PKE), non-malleability, and the PKE implication lattice |
| [`signatures.md`](signatures.md) | EUF-CMA, SUF-CMA, and the state-reuse obligation stateful hash-based schemes carry |
| [`hash.md`](hash.md) | The seven Rogaway–Shrimpton notions and their unconditional and provisional implications |
| [`symmetric-aead.md`](symmetric-aead.md) | IND-CPA, INT-PTXT/INT-CTXT, and generic composition |
| [`nist-categories.md`](nist-categories.md) | Categories I–V, quoted from the CFP, and the four traps in claiming one |
| [`mismatches.md`](mismatches.md) | The checklist `analyze-paper` runs — twelve recurring findings |


**These are not here to teach a cryptographer what IND-CCA2 means.** They are
here because of a measured failure mode: models "mimic the syntactic structure
of proof languages … without truly underlying mathematical principles, such as
the precise meaning of 'one-way function', 'pseudorandom', 'computationally
indistinguishable'" ([AICrypto §5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09580); see
`docs/ROADMAP.md` §3, failure class 2). The observed failure is **not ignorance
of a definition — it is asserting a definition is satisfied without evaluating
it.** A glossary does not help with that. A list of obligations that must each
be discharged does.

So every notion below is written as:

- **Game** — setup, oracle access, win condition. Enough to be unambiguous.
- **Obligations** — what a proof of this notion *must* discharge. Each is a
  checkbox. A proof that does not address one has a gap, whatever it says.
- **Operational break** — what `verify-claim` actually runs at toy parameters.

**Three standing rules.**

1. **Name the notion before answering "is it secure".** The question is
   meaningless otherwise, and drift between notions mid-argument is the single
   most common review finding this file exists to catch.
2. **Never report "verified".** Computation falsifies; it does not verify. The
   vocabulary is "no counterexample at n ≤ N", with N stated.
3. **State the model with the notion.** "IND-CCA2" alone is incomplete;
   "IND-CCA2 in the ROM" and "IND-CCA2 in the standard model" are different
   claims with different strengths.

**Still a gap:** a primary citation for the SUF ⟹ EUF separation in
[`signatures.md`](signatures.md). The
relation is standard and the separation is witnessed by any re-randomisable
scheme, but this file should cite rather than assert, and the corpus search did
not surface a canonical source. Recorded rather than papered over.
