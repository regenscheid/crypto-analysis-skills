## NIST security categories

**Where the definition lives, and why that matters.** FIPS 203's glossary defines
*security category* only as "a number associated with the security strength of a
post-quantum cryptographic algorithm, as specified by NIST (see [7])" — it
defers. The ladder itself is in the **PQC Call for Proposals** (Dec 2016), which
is a project document, **not in the NIST connector's index** (that covers the 924
numbered publications). It is fetchable directly:
`csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/documents/call-for-proposals-final-dec-2016.pdf`

The ladder is also available **in-connector** via **SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 6 ipd**
(verified: 578,660 chars, carries the category descriptions and nine mentions of
MAXDEPTH). Prefer it for routine lookups; go to the CFP for the two things
Rev. 6 drops — the "all metrics" requirement and the ordering footnote.

Verbatim from that document — each category is "any attack that breaks the
relevant security definition must require computational resources comparable to
or greater than those required for":

| Cat | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **1** | key search on a block cipher with a 128-bit key (e.g. AES128) |
| **2** | collision search on a 256-bit hash function (e.g. SHA256/SHA3-256) |
| **3** | key search on a block cipher with a 192-bit key (e.g. AES192) |
| **4** | collision search on a 384-bit hash function (e.g. SHA384/SHA3-384) |
| **5** | key search on a block cipher with a 256-bit key (e.g. AES 256) |

**Four things that make category claims treacherous.**

1. **The pegs are computational-resource comparisons, not bit counts.** The CFP
   says resources "may be measured using a variety of different metrics (e.g.,
   number of classical elementary operations, quantum circuit size, etc.)" and
   requires the threshold be met "with respect to **all** metrics that NIST deems
   to be potentially relevant". A single-metric argument does not establish a
   category.
2. **The pegs are themselves estimates that have moved.** Quantum gate counts for
   AES have been revised (e.g. [2019/854](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/854)). A
   category is a moving target, not a constant.
3. **Category claims have been withdrawn in practice.** IR 8413 records that
   during round 3 "two attacks were discovered which called into question the
   claimed category 5 security of parameter sets using SHA-256." Treat a category
   claim as a claim, not a fact.
4. **"Security category" is overloaded inside NIST.** FIPS 199 uses it for
   *information-system impact levels* (low/moderate/high), unrelated to PQC
   strength, and the connector surfaces the information-system sense first —
   `"security category"` returns SP 800-60 and ITL Bulletins, not the PQC
   ladder. (An earlier note here cited FIPS 199 as the top hit; that was an
   artifact of querying `"security categor"`, which FTS5 treats as a literal
   token rather than a prefix. The collision is real; that evidence for it was
   not.)

**Obligations for any category claim.**
- [ ] Category number stated, and which parameter set it applies to
- [ ] The metric(s) under which the threshold is claimed
- [ ] Whether the claim is against classical or quantum resources, or both
- [ ] **MAXDEPTH accounted for.** The CFP's quantum thresholds are all
      depth-divided — 2^170/MAXDEPTH for AES-128, 2^233/MAXDEPTH for AES-192,
      2^298/MAXDEPTH for AES-256 — because a quantum attack's usable parallelism
      is bounded by how long a coherent computation can run. A quantum cost
      quoted without a MAXDEPTH assumption is not comparable to the threshold.
- [ ] Cross-checked against an estimator (`lattice-estimator`,
      `cryptographic_estimators`) with a **named cost model** — never a bare λ
