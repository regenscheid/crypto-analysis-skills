# Evidence, Trust, and TCB Audit

## Purpose

Identifies exactly what must be trusted for a formal or certified result and prevents untrusted search, extraction, native evaluation, opaque models, or hidden axioms from being presented as kernel-checked proof.

## Use this skill when

Use this skill before accepting or publishing any generated proof, solver certificate, extracted-code theorem, protocol result, or rigorous numerical claim.

## Do not invoke automatically

Do not equate “the tool exited successfully” with a small trusted computing base. Some workflows trust compilers, extractors, native code, SMT solvers, handwritten models, or external theorem declarations unless the artifact is independently reconstructed.

## Optional entry contract

**Inputs**
- proof or certificate artifact
- toolchain manifest
- formal claim

**Expected products**
- TCB inventory
- axiom and assumption report
- trust classification
- remediation tasks

This skill is an optional specialist route. Completion of an ordinary cryptanalysis task does not require invoking it unless the claim or evidence goal warrants formal methods.

## Operating procedure

1. Inventory every executable and semantic component from source artifact to accepted theorem: parsers, translators, compilers, libraries, kernels, tactics, solvers, certificate checkers, native evaluators, code generators, hardware models, and scripts.
2. Classify each component as kernel/checker trusted, specification trusted, certificate-producing but untrusted, proof-generating with reconstruction, assumed-correct translation, empirical oracle, or environment dependency.
3. Inspect the theorem dependency closure for axioms, admitted results, `sorry`/`admit`, unsafe declarations, opaque native computations, unverified reflection, foreign-function calls, and imported precompiled artifacts.
4. For Lean, distinguish kernel reduction and proof terms from `native_decide`, custom kernels, compiled plugins, and project build steps. Use the official trust guidance and record exceptions.
5. For extraction workflows, list the Rust/LLVM/assembly semantics and all library or intrinsic models. A theorem about an extracted model inherits assumptions about translation and model fidelity.
6. For solver workflows, determine whether SAT/SMT/PB output is merely status, a checkable certificate, or a proof reconstructed in the central prover. Include the encoding generator and correspondence theorem.
7. For probabilistic and protocol tools, record the mathematical soundness result of the logic, admitted axioms, symbolic-versus-computational model, boundedness, equational theory, and termination limitations.
8. For numerical results, distinguish exact arithmetic, directed rounding/ball arithmetic, high-precision reference computation, and ordinary floating-point experiments.
9. Produce a concise claim-level trust statement: “The result is valid if A, B, and C hold; X and Y were independently checked; Z remains outside the theorem.”

## Output contract

- A layered TCB inventory and data-flow diagram.
- An assumption/axiom report tied to theorem IDs.
- A classification of each external result as checked, reconstructed, or trusted.
- Remediation options that reduce the TCB or make residual assumptions explicit.

## Non-negotiable guardrails

- Do not claim that a small proof-assistant kernel validates the handwritten formal specification.
- Do not omit the build system or package sources from the execution trust boundary.
- Do not treat a solver as untrusted if the checker still trusts an unverified parser or translation without recording that fact.
- Publish non-claims and residual assumptions beside the main theorem, not in a hidden appendix.
