"""Check that the numbers a document claims are the numbers its commands produce.

    python3 reproduce.py DOC.md            # list what it would run, and the claims
    python3 reproduce.py DOC.md --run      # actually run them and compare

Step 3 of `verify-claim`, made mechanical. The failure it exists to catch is
specific and was observed rather than imagined: a parameter set changed, some
downstream numbers were recomputed and others were carried forward, and a
key-recovery figure ended up 10.2 bits wrong inside a rubric whose stated
tolerance was +/-0.5. Nothing in the document looked wrong. Every number was
plausible, formatted identically, and sitting next to the command that was
supposed to have produced it.

A human re-reading the file cannot catch that. Running the commands can.

The check is deliberately one-directional and blunt: for every `2^x` the prose
claims, does SOME listed command actually emit it? That is weaker than mapping
each claim to its own command, and it is what can be done without the document
declaring a machine-readable link between the two. It catches stale values,
transposed digits and numbers no command produces at all -- which is the whole
observed failure population.

Commands are NOT run without `--run`, and only commands from fenced blocks in the
document are ever considered. Read them before passing the flag. A fenced
invocation of this verifier is documentation, not a command that generates a
claim, and is excluded to prevent recursive self-execution.
