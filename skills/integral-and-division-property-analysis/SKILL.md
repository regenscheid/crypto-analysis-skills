# Integral and Division-Property Analysis

## Use this skill when

The primitive has byte/word/bit structure, controllable input sets, bounded algebraic-degree growth, or diffusion patterns that may produce balanced, constant, or otherwise predictable aggregates.

## Operating procedure

1. **Define the input multiset.** Specify active, constant, balanced, all, unknown, repeated, or affine-subspace coordinates and multiplicities. State whether data are chosen plaintexts, nonces, tweaks, states, or messages.
2. **Define the observed aggregate.** XOR sum, modular sum, parity, monomial sum, multiset equality, or another exact statistic. Avoid using “balanced” without naming the algebra and coordinate.
3. **Analyze direct integrals.** Propagate structured sets through rounds, track cancellations and bijective mappings, and verify with exhaustive reduced examples.
4. **Analyze algebraic degree.** Bound or compute degree growth, including key/constant variables and initialization/finalization. Translate higher-order derivatives into exact data and output predictions.
5. **Build a division-property model.** Choose word-based, bit-based, or generalized division property. Encode S-box/Boolean/linear/addition transitions with justified soundness. State whether the model is exact or over-approximating.
6. **Validate the model.** Exhaustively compare possible monomials/properties for small components and rounds. Directly test solver witnesses and known distinguishers.
7. **Optimize data complexity.** Count the full structured set, repeated structures, partial sums, and feasibility under the target interface/codebook.
8. **Extend to key recovery.** Add rounds, identify partial decryptions and guessed subkeys, derive zero/nonzero tests, false positives, candidate counts, and verification.
9. **Account for key dependence and cancellations.** Determine whether the property holds for all keys, most keys, or only in expectation. Test multiple keys and avoid assuming independent output coordinates.
10. **Compare with alternative explanations.** Check whether a found property is simply a lower-order differential, invariant subspace, or generic full-codebook effect.

## Output contract

Provide:

- exact input multiset and output aggregate;
- direct, degree-based, or division-property derivation;
- model soundness/completeness evidence;
- round and key-schedule scope;
- exact data structures and codebook feasibility;
- recovery extension and filtering statistics;
- exhaustive/statistical validation;
- complete resources and claim impact.

## Non-negotiable guardrails

- Bind every statement to the exact target artifact, version, parameters, round/phase scope, and adversary model.
- Label a result accurately as a property, trail, differential/linear hull, distinguisher, recovery attack, forgery, collision, proof gap, or implementation failure.
- Never describe a reduced-round, weak-key, related-key, nonce-misuse, chosen-ciphertext, Q2, or component-only result as a full-scheme break without the corresponding full-scheme model.
- Recompute data, time, memory, preprocessing, communication, verification, and success probability; do not copy headline exponents without their units and assumptions.
- Preserve contradictory evidence, failed reproductions, corrections, and source-version chronology.
- Treat solver timeout, bounded search failure, and absence of a known attack as inconclusive—not as evidence of security.
- Mark every inference that is not directly established by a proof, derivation, experiment, or cited source.
