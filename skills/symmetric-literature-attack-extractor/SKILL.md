# Literature Attack Extractor

## Use this skill when

Reading a paper, preprint, thesis, standards comment, issue, code artifact, talk, or internal agent report that claims a cryptanalytic property or attack. Run it before attempting to adapt the result.

## Operating procedure

1. **Collect the source family.** Obtain the earliest public version, latest ePrint/final version, errata, supplementary material, code, test vectors, slides only when they add information, designer responses, and independent follow-up work.
2. **Freeze provenance.** Record title, authors, date, version/hash, exact page/section/theorem/table/algorithm, and artifact commit. Preserve what changed between revisions.
3. **Identify the exact target.** Record primitive/spec version, parameters, round count, phases, key schedule assumptions, and whether the paper studies a component, idealized variant, reduced-round construction, or full scheme.
4. **Classify the result.** Use one or more of: structural observation, trail, differential/hull, distinguisher, key/state recovery, forgery, collision/preimage/second-preimage, proof gap, implementation discrepancy, or security reduction.
5. **Extract the adversary model.** Record all oracle access, data control, adaptivity, key/tweak/nonce relations, single/multi-user setting, preprocessing, weak-key conditions, and classical/Q1/Q2 access.
6. **Write the attack skeleton.** Express the attack as a sequence of indispensable transformations independent of the source’s notation: data structure, propagated property, middle condition, guessed material, filtering statistic, ranking, verification.
7. **Extract every requirement.** Include exact state alignment, operation identities, independence/Markov assumptions, key-schedule relations, available degrees of freedom, data structures, memory access, and implementation capabilities.
8. **Recompute headline quantities.** Check trail probability/correlation, cluster aggregation, number of structures, filtering rates, key guesses, false positives, verification work, and success probability. Mark omitted constants and unclear units.
9. **Separate evidence types.** Label theorem, derivation, heuristic, simulation, concrete experiment, solver output, code, or assertion. A plot without raw data and a theorem with unchecked premises have different status.
10. **Record limitations and unresolved questions.** Include model mismatch, parameter restrictions, non-reproduced claims, unavailable code, fragile heuristics, and later corrections or rebuttals.

## Output contract

Create one record conforming to `assets/attack-record.schema.json`, plus:

- a source chronology;
- exact quotation locators without excessive quotation;
- an attack skeleton;
- a requirement list ready for the transfer matrix;
- recomputed complexity/success notes;
- reproduction status and missing artifacts;
- open questions ranked by their effect on the conclusion.

Do not summarize a source as “breaks X.” State exactly what result it establishes, under which model, and at what scope.

## Non-negotiable guardrails

- Bind every statement to the exact target artifact, version, parameters, round/phase scope, and adversary model.
- Label a result accurately as a property, trail, differential/linear hull, distinguisher, recovery attack, forgery, collision, proof gap, or implementation failure.
- Never describe a reduced-round, weak-key, related-key, nonce-misuse, chosen-ciphertext, Q2, or component-only result as a full-scheme break without the corresponding full-scheme model.
- Recompute data, time, memory, preprocessing, communication, verification, and success probability; do not copy headline exponents without their units and assumptions.
- Preserve contradictory evidence, failed reproductions, corrections, and source-version chronology.
- Treat solver timeout, bounded search failure, and absence of a known attack as inconclusive—not as evidence of security.
- Mark every inference that is not directly established by a proof, derivation, experiment, or cited source.
