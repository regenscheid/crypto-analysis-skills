# Attack families: lattice (LWE, NTRU, SIS)

Load this checklist for the lattice-family coverage phase of `analyze-scheme`.

## The rule this file exists to enforce

> **Walk every family. Check each family's preconditions *before* running it.
> Report the cheapest, not the familiar one.**

Both halves are load-bearing, and each targets a measured failure.

**Walking every family** prevents pattern matching from replacing analysis.
Measured on ML-KEM-512 with `RC.MATZOV`:

| Family | cost | |
|---|---|---|
| `dual_hybrid` | **2^139.7** | cheapest |
| `primal_bdd` | 2^140.2 | |
| `primal_usvp` | 2^143.8 | **the one usually quoted** |
| `dual` | 2^149.9 | |
| `coded_bkw` | 2^178.8 | |
| `primal_hybrid` | 2^262.1 | |

Quoting `primal_usvp` alone overstates security by **4 bits**. That is small
here and is not always small — the same check on UOV moved ov-Is and ov-V by
17–20 bits (`multivariate.md`, when written).

**Checking preconditions first** targets class 3's other half: firing an attack
without verifying its hypotheses hold. In this domain the estimator will often
tell you — but only if you read the exception instead of catching it.

## How to read an entry

- **Applies when** — the precondition. Check before running, not after.
- **Fails how** — what you see when it does not apply. Several of these surface
  as exceptions, and an exception is a *result*, not an error to be swallowed.
- **Call** — the `lattice-estimator` invocation.
- **Bites when** — the structural deviation that makes this family the winner.
  This is the `analyze-scheme` step-6 hook.

Every cost below is `RC.MATZOV` unless stated. **Never report a bare λ** — see
"Cost models" at the end.

## Primal attacks

### `primal_usvp` — unique-SVP embedding

- **Applies when** always, for LWE with a unique/bounded solution. The default
  baseline.
- **Fails how** n/a.
- **Call** `LWE.primal_usvp(params, red_cost_model=RC.MATZOV)`
- **Bites when** nothing special — it is the floor everyone quotes, which is
  exactly why it must not be the only one run.

Returns β (BKZ blocksize) and d (lattice dimension) alongside the cost. β is the
number to sanity-check against published figures: ML-KEM-512/768/1024 give
**β = 406 / 624 / 874**.

### `primal_bdd` — bounded-distance decoding

- **Applies when** always. Uses a Babai/Nearest-Plane step after reduction, so it
  can beat uSVP when the embedding wastes the error's structure.
- **Fails how** n/a.
- **Call** `LWE.primal_bdd(params, red_cost_model=RC.MATZOV)`
- **Bites when** the secret and error distributions differ, or the error is small
  relative to q. On ML-KEM-512 it beats `primal_usvp` (2^140.2 vs 2^143.8) —
  **so the "standard" primal number is already not the cheapest primal attack.**

### `primal_hybrid` — meet-in-the-middle guessing plus reduction

- **Applies when** the secret is **sparse or small-support**. Guessing part of
  the secret only pays if guessing is cheap.
- **Fails how** it does not throw — it silently returns a much *worse* number.
  On ML-KEM-512 (centred binomial, dense secret) it gives **2^262.1**, ~120 bits
  worse than uSVP. A large `primal_hybrid` result is evidence the precondition is
  absent, not evidence of security.
- **Call** `LWE.primal_hybrid(params, red_cost_model=RC.MATZOV)`
- **Bites when** the scheme uses **sparse ternary secrets**, fixed Hamming
  weight, or small-support distributions — common in FHE parameter sets and in
  some NTRU variants. If a design chose a sparse secret for performance, this is
  the family that punishes it.

### `primal_dsd` — dense sublattice discovery *(NTRU only)*

- **Applies when** NTRU with a **large modulus relative to n** — the
  "overstretched" regime.
- **Fails how** absent from `LWE`; only exposed on `NTRU`.
- **Call** `NTRU.primal_dsd(params, red_cost_model=RC.MATZOV)`
- **Bites when** q is pushed up to reduce decryption failures or to support
  homomorphic depth. This is the attack that killed overstretched-NTRU
  constructions, and **the deviation that triggers it is a parameter choice made
  for performance, not for security** — precisely the step-6 pattern.

## Dual attacks

### `dual` and `dual_hybrid`

- **Applies when** always for `dual`; `dual_hybrid` additionally guesses secret
  coordinates and so benefits from small/sparse secrets — but note it still won
  on ML-KEM-512's dense secret.
- **Fails how** n/a.
- **Call** `LWE.dual(p, red_cost_model=RC.MATZOV)` /
  `LWE.dual_hybrid(p, red_cost_model=RC.MATZOV)`
- **Bites when** the sample count m is generous, or the secret is small. On
  ML-KEM-512 `dual_hybrid` is **the cheapest family of all nine at 2^139.7**.

### ⚠ The dual-attack caveat — do not report a dual number bare

The cost model for dual-sieve attacks is **actively disputed**, and this is the
single most important caveat in this file.

[2023/302](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/302) — Ducas, Pulles, *Does the
Dual-Sieve Attack on Learning with Errors even Work?* — argues that the standard
heuristic analysis of dual-sieve attacks is contradicted by experiment, so
published dual costs may not reflect attainable attacks.
[2023/1508](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1508) — Pouly, Shen, *Provable Dual
Attacks on Learning with Errors* — responds with provable variants. The
literature has continued to move.

**Obligations when a dual attack is the cheapest family:**
- [ ] Say so, and say that the dual cost model is disputed — cite 2023/302
- [ ] Report the cheapest **primal** cost alongside it, as the defensible number
- [ ] Do not let a dual number alone drive a "broken" claim without a
      corroborating primal result or an implementation

This matters directly for the table above: `dual_hybrid` beats `primal_usvp` by
4 bits on ML-KEM-512, and that 4 bits sits inside the disputed region.

## Algebraic and combinatorial families

### `arora_gb` — Arora–Ge

- **Applies when** the noise is **very small and bounded** — essentially, when
  the error takes few values.
- **Fails how** on ML-KEM-512 it raises `int too large to convert to float` —
  the cost overflows a double. **That exception is the answer**: the family is
  astronomically inapplicable at binomial noise. Catch it, report "inapplicable
  (cost overflow)", and do not let it abort the sweep.
- **Call** `LWE.arora_gb(params)`
- **Bites when** a design uses a **bounded, low-entropy error** — binary or
  ternary error, or an error distribution truncated for implementation
  convenience. That is a classic performance-motivated deviation.

### `coded_bkw`

- **Applies when** **many samples** are available — BKW-family attacks are
  sample-hungry.
- **Fails how** returns a large number rather than throwing when m is tight.
  2^178.8 on ML-KEM-512.
- **Call** `LWE.coded_bkw(params)`
- **Bites when** the scheme exposes unlimited samples — a key-reuse or
  many-ciphertext setting rather than the m = n of a KEM.

### `mitm` and `exhaustive_search`

- **Applies when** enough samples exist. Both state their requirement precisely.
- **Fails how** explicit, useful exceptions:
  - `mitm` → `MITM: Need 728 samples but only 512 available.`
  - `exhaustive_search` → `Need 8012.8 samples`
  **Record the requirement and the shortfall** — "needs 728, has 512" is a more
  informative line in a report than "not applicable".
- **Bites when** m is unbounded, or n is small enough that brute force is real
  (toy parameters, and the reduced-parameter ladders used by `validate-attack`).

---

## SIS

`SIS.Parameters(n, q, length_bound, m=None, norm=2, tag=None)`. Distinct from
LWE: the governing quantity is the norm bound β relative to q and the dimensions.

Two families:

### `SIS.lattice`
- **Applies when** always. The standard lattice-reduction attack.
- **Call** `SIS.lattice(params)`

### `SIS.large_norm`
- **Applies when** the norm bound is **large relative to q** — there is a regime
  where the bound is loose enough that a different approach wins.
- **Fails how** returns **`2^inf`** rather than throwing. Measured on an ML-DSA-44
  shaped instance (n=1024, q=8380417, β=350209, m=2048): `lattice` gives
  **2^263.9** while `large_norm` gives **2^inf** — inapplicable at that bound.
  An `inf` here is a precondition failure, not a security result, and must not be
  reported as "no attack found".

**Obligation: check which norm the claim is in.** `norm` defaults to **2**; ℓ∞
bounds are extremely common in signature schemes (ML-DSA states its bounds in
ℓ∞). Estimating an ℓ∞ bound under the ℓ₂ default silently answers a different
question, and nothing in the output flags it.
- [ ] `norm` set to match the specification's bound
- [ ] β taken from the spec, not inferred from a related parameter

---

## Running the whole sweep

`LWE.estimate(params)` runs everything, but three families throw rather than
return on typical KEM parameters, so a naive loop aborts partway. Catch per
family and record the exception text as the applicability finding:

```python
from estimator import *
import math
p = LWE.Parameters(n=512, q=3329, Xs=ND.CenteredBinomial(3),
                   Xe=ND.CenteredBinomial(3), m=512)
FAMILIES = ["primal_usvp", "primal_bdd", "primal_hybrid",
            "dual", "dual_hybrid", "arora_gb", "coded_bkw",
            "mitm", "exhaustive_search"]
for name in FAMILIES:
    fn = getattr(LWE, name)
    try:
        r = fn(p, red_cost_model=RC.MATZOV) if name.startswith(("primal", "dual")) else fn(p)
        print(name, "2^%.1f" % math.log2(float(r["rop"])))
    except Exception as exc:                 # the exception IS the precondition
        print(name, "inapplicable:", exc)
```

**It is slow.** The UOV sweep took 4m06s for four parameter sets; budget
accordingly and do not run every family on every parameter set by reflex.

## Cost models — never report a bare λ

`RC` exposes: `ADPS16`, `BDGL16`, `MATZOV`, `CheNgu12`, `ABLR21`, `ABFKSW20`,
`ChaLoy21`, `GJ21`, `Kyber`, `LaaMosPol14`, `LLL`.

Same instance, same β, different model:

| Model | ML-KEM-512 | 768 | 1024 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ADPS16` — core-SVP, classical | 2^118.6 | 2^182.2 | 2^255.2 |
| `MATZOV` — 2022 gate-count refinement | 2^143.8 | 2^204.9 | 2^275.1 |
| `BDGL16` — sieve, gate count | 2^147.9 | 2^212.1 | 2^285.5 |
| `CheNgu12` — enumeration | 2^280.8 | 2^485.4 | 2^745.3 |

**25 bits** between two defensible sieving models; 160+ across the table.
`CheNgu12` prices a different algorithm family (enumeration, not sieving) and is
not apples-to-apples with the rest.

**Obligations for any reported cost:**
- [ ] Model named
- [ ] Spread reported where models disagree materially
- [ ] `ADPS16` given when comparing against a NIST submission's own claim, since
      core-SVP is the convention those are stated in
- [ ] Estimator commit recorded — these measurements used
      `lattice-estimator` at `3e48ef42`
- [ ] Sage and Python versions printed with the result

---

## Verification status

Every number in this file was produced on this machine with
`lattice-estimator` @ `3e48ef42` under the Claude Science `sage` env
(SageMath 10.7), not recalled. The β values 406/624/874 and the ADPS16 row
reproduce the ML-KEM submission's published core-SVP figures.

SIS was exercised too: an ML-DSA-44-shaped instance gives `lattice` 2^263.9 and
`large_norm` 2^inf, which is where the `large_norm` precondition above comes from.

**Not verified here:** `primal_dsd` has not been run against a real overstretched
NTRU parameter set — the family and its trigger are documented from the cited
sources, not from a measurement on this machine. Marked rather than implied.
