# Attack families: multivariate and code-based

UOV, MQ, MinRank, Permuted Kernel, Linear Equivalence. Layer 3 of
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, consumed by `analyze-scheme` steps 3–4. Companion to
`lattice.md`; the same rule applies:

> **Walk every family. Check each family's preconditions *before* running it.
> Report the cheapest, not the familiar one.**

## Why this domain punishes the familiar answer hardest

The obvious algebraic attack on an MQ system is a Gröbner basis — **F5**. On an
ov-Ip-shaped system (n=112, m=44, q=256), measured on this machine:

| Family | cost | |
|---|---|---|
| **PXL** | **2^134.5** | cheapest |
| BooleanSolveFXL | 2^144.5 | |
| Crossbred | 2^153.2 | |
| HybridF5 | 2^167.8 | |
| Hashimoto | 2^177.2 | *underdetermined systems only* |
| **F5** | **2^243.0** | **the obvious one** |

**F5 is 108 bits worse than the cheapest family.** Running the obvious algebraic
attack and reporting its cost would overstate security by more than a hundred
bits — the largest gap between the familiar answer and the right one anywhere in
these checklists. For comparison, the same failure costs 4 bits on ML-KEM-512 and
17–20 bits on UOV at the scheme level.

Consistency check worth knowing: `UOVEstimator`'s `DirectAttack` on ov-Ip returns
**2^134.5**, exactly matching `MQEstimator`'s PXL. The scheme-level estimator is
driving the problem-level one and already picks the best family — so *use the
scheme estimator where one exists*, and drop to `MQEstimator` only when analysing
a raw system or a scheme with no dedicated estimator.

## Scheme level: `UOVEstimator`

Five families. Measured on the NIST UOV submission parameter sets:

| | ov-Is (q=16) | ov-Ip (q=256) | ov-III | ov-V |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DirectAttack | 2^158.5 | **2^134.5** | 2^214.1 | 2^276.8 |
| KipnisShamir | 2^152.5 | 2^217.1 | 2^347.1 | 2^444.2 |
| CollisionAttack | **2^141.0** | 2^189.3 | 2^301.6 | 2^397.8 |
| IntersectionAttack | 2^175.0 | 2^164.6 | 2^248.9 | 2^310.5 |
| WedgeAttack | 2^174.8 | 2^139.6 | **2^205.9** | **2^256.7** |

**The cheapest family changes with the parameter set** — Collision at q=16,
Direct at ov-Ip, Wedge at both high levels. Running only DirectAttack overstates
ov-Is by 17.5 bits and ov-V by 20.1 bits.

- **`DirectAttack`** — solve the public system directly. Delegates to the MQ
  families below. *Bites when* m is small relative to n.
- **`KipnisShamir`** — exploits the oil-subspace structure. *Bites when* the
  oil/vinegar split is unbalanced; note it is worst at large q here.
- **`CollisionAttack`** — birthday-style. *Bites when* **q is small** — it wins
  at q=16 and loses badly at q=256. Memory-hungry: 2^131.7 memory at ov-Is.
      **Check the memory column before calling it the cheapest attack.**
- **`IntersectionAttack`** — Beullens. *Bites when* n/m is close to 2.
- **`WedgeAttack`** — recent; wins at the high security levels. Its presence is
  why this list must be regenerated when the library updates: a new family can
  silently become the cheapest.

**Cost:** `UOVEstimator.estimate()` over those four sets took **4m06s**. Do not
run it on every parameter set by reflex.

## Problem level: `MQEstimator`

14 families, and **most are field- or shape-restricted**. Preconditions below
were established by running each in isolation, not recalled.

### Field restrictions — established empirically

| Family | q=2 | q=256 |
|---|---|---|
| `Bjorklund` | 2^62.7 | **not offered** |
| `DinurFirst` | 2^54.8 | **not offered** |
| `DinurSecond` | **2^45.4** (cheapest at q=2) | **not offered** |
| `Lokshtanov` | 2^88.8 | **crashes** — `ValueError: math domain error` |
| `PXL`, `BooleanSolveFXL`, `Crossbred`, `HybridF5`, `F5`, `ExhaustiveSearch` | ✓ | ✓ |

- **`Bjorklund`, `DinurFirst`, `DinurSecond` are Boolean-only.** They are the
  right families for a q=2 system and simply absent otherwise.
- **`Lokshtanov` raises rather than returning inf at large q.** Catch it; the
  exception is the precondition. Do not let it abort a sweep.
- **The ranking inverts with q.** At q=2 the order is DinurSecond <
  ExhaustiveSearch < HybridF5 < Crossbred < BooleanSolveFXL < PXL. At q=256 it
  is PXL < BooleanSolveFXL < Crossbred < HybridF5 < F5 < ExhaustiveSearch.
  **A family ranking carried over from a Boolean instance is wrong at q=256.**

### Shape restrictions

`CGMTA`, `KPG`, `MHT`, `Hashimoto` are offered only for particular m-to-n
relationships.

- **`Hashimoto` appears only when the system is underdetermined.** Present at
  n=112, m=44 (2^177.2); **not offered** at n=m=44. Since a UOV public map *is*
  underdetermined, this family is live for UOV-like schemes and dead for square
  systems.
- `CGMTA`, `KPG`, `MHT` were not offered at either shape tested. Their conditions
  are narrower still — do not assume absence means inapplicability in general,
  only that it was inapplicable here.

### Running it

```python
from cryptographic_estimators.MQEstimator import MQEstimator
from cryptographic_estimators.MQEstimator.mq_algorithm import MQAlgorithm
ALL = {c.__name__: c for c in MQAlgorithm.__subclasses__()}

# excluded_algorithms takes CLASSES, not names -- passing strings raises
# "TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class"
E = MQEstimator(n=112, m=44, q=256)
for name, d in sorted(E.estimate().items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1]["estimate"]["time"]):
    print(name, "2^%.1f" % d["estimate"]["time"])
```

### ⚠ Report the memory-access spread — the multivariate analogue of the cost model

`lattice.md` mandates a cost-model spread and this file had no equivalent, which
was a real gap. `cryptographic_estimators` takes a `memory_access` parameter, and
on **ov-Ip** the cheapest cost moves:

| `memory_access` | cheapest |
|---|---|
| 0 — constant | 2^134.5 |
| 1 — logarithmic | 2^138.3 |
| 3 — cube-root | 2^166.8 |
| 2 — square-root | **2^184.4** |

**A 50-bit spread, and it flips the category-1 verdict.** Reporting 2^134.5 alone
is the multivariate equivalent of reporting a bare λ. `sweep.py` now prints all
four rows.

**Report memory as well as time.** Several of these are memory-bound;
`CollisionAttack` at ov-Is needs 2^131.7. A time-cheapest attack that needs more
memory than atoms in the observable universe is not the cheapest attack.

## MinRank — `MREstimator`

`SupportMinors`, `KernelSearch`, `BigK`, `Minors`, `BruteForce`.

Load-bearing for the Rainbow break ([2022/214](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214),
Beullens, *Breaking Rainbow Takes a Weekend on a Laptop*) and for MiRitH. *Bites
when* a scheme's public map has low-rank structure — which is what every
oil-and-vinegar trapdoor is. **This is the family `UOVEstimator` cannot reach**,
and its absence is why the blind regression's Rainbow arms could not close their
own finding with a measurement.

**Now wired up**: `sweep.py minrank q= m= n= k= r=`. Verified on a small instance
(q=16, m=n=15, k=78, r=6): BruteForce 2^143.8, SupportMinors 2^144.0,
Minors 2^144.7, KernelSearch 2^147.7, BigK 2^154.7.

`MRProblem(q, m, n, k, r)` — m×n matrices, a k-dimensional span, target rank r.

**Two honest limits.**

*The scheme → MinRank reduction is not automated, deliberately.* Deriving
(q,m,n,k,r) from a scheme's parameters **is** the attack, it differs per scheme,
and an unverified mapping is worse than none. For Rainbow the reduction is: for
x ∈ O₂ the first o₁ columns of M_x = [P₁x | … | P_mx] vanish, so
rank(M_x) ≤ m − o₁, giving a rectangular MinRank instance over the span of the
M_i. State your reduction, then pass the instance.

*It is slow at cryptographic sizes.* A k=100, r=32 instance — Rainbow-I's shape —
**ran past 10 minutes without returning**, where the whole four-set UOV sweep
takes 4m06s. Budget for it, and expect to background it.

Newer literature worth reading before trusting an old mapping:
[2025/739](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/739) extends the rectangular MinRank
attack to UOV and its variants.

## Permuted Kernel — `PKEstimator`

`KMP`, `SBC`. Underlies **PERK**.

## Linear Equivalence — `LEEstimator`

`Leon`, `Beullens`, `BBPS`. Underlies **LESS**. Note this reference set and the ePrint
connector both record that "LESS" collides with the English word in search — see
`connectors/eprint/corpus.py` SYNONYMS.

Both enumerated from the API; **costs not measured here.**

## The Magma dependency, and why it is real

Everything above is *estimation*. Actually **running** an algebraic attack —
computing a Gröbner basis to check a claimed degree of regularity, or solving a
small instance end-to-end for `validate-attack` — bottoms out in a Gröbner
engine, and **Magma's F4 is materially faster than Sage's route through
Singular** on large systems over F_q.

That is the entire justification for the remote Magma host (`docs/ROADMAP.md`
M4), now connected and reached via `compute_submit` — see `skills/magma/`.
Without it:

- **Estimation** works fully, locally, today — this file.
- **Verification of a degree-of-regularity claim** does not. Do not assert that a
  system behaves semi-regularly without computing it; record it as unverified.

---

## Verification status

Measured on this machine, `cryptographic_estimators` 2.1.1 under the Claude
Science `sage` env: the five UOV families across four NIST parameter sets; MQ
family applicability at q=2 and q=256; MQ family costs at n=m=44 and at n=112,
m=44; the `Lokshtanov` crash; the `Hashimoto` underdetermined-only behaviour.

**Not measured:** MinRank, PKP and LESS costs — families enumerated from the API
only. `RSDEstimator` could not be enumerated the same way (submodule path differs
from the others); it exists and imports, but its family list is unconfirmed.
