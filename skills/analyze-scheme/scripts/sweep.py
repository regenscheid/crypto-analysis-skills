"""Walk every attack family for a hard problem, and report what applies.

The point of this script is that **an exception is a result, not an error**.
Several families announce their own preconditions by raising -- MITM says "Need
728 samples but only 512 available", Arora-Ge overflows a double because its
cost is astronomical at binomial noise, Lokshtanov raises a math domain error
over large fields. A sweep that lets any of those abort loses the finding, and a
sweep that swallows them silently loses it too. Both are reported here.

Run under the Claude Science sage env:

    ~/.claude-science/conda/envs/sage/bin/sage --python sweep.py lwe ML-KEM-512
    ~/.claude-science/conda/envs/sage/bin/sage --python sweep.py lwe n=512 q=3329 eta=3

    """Subfield Differential Attack on a lifted scheme -- the model nothing else has.

    `subfield` prices the NAIVE restriction to F_q and correctly refuses to call it
    a forgery, because a solution in F_q^n hits a uniform target in F_{q^r}^m with
    probability q^-m(r-1). That guard is real but it is not the end of the story,
    and stopping there UNDERSTATES the attack.

    Ding et al. (2nd PQC Standardization Conference, "New Attacks on Lifted
    Unbalanced Oil Vinegar") remove the obstacle with a SHIFT. Pick an arbitrary
    x' in K^n and look for x-bar in an INTERMEDIATE subfield F_{q^d}, d | r, with
    P(x' + x-bar) = h. The shift absorbs whatever part of the target does not lie
    in the subfield, so there is no reachability penalty at all; the failure
    probability is exp(-q^{d*n - r*m}), negligible whenever d*n > r*m.

    Writing K = F_{q^d}[t]/f(t) with deg f = s = r/d and comparing coefficients of
    t^0..t^{s-1}: the quadratic part has F_q coefficients and therefore stays in
    the constant term, so the higher coefficients give (s-1)m LINEAR equations.
    What is left is m equations in n-(s-1)m variables over F_{q^d}, which
    Thomae-Wolf reduces to a square system of m - floor((n-(s-1)m)/m).

    THIS IS WHY d MATTERS AND WHY r's FACTORISATION IS A DESIGN PARAMETER. A prime
    r offers only d in {1, r} -- the naive case and no reduction at all.

    That is not a hypothetical. The round-2 LUOV sets this attack broke use
    composite r (8, 48, 64, 80); the LUOV team's RESPONSE was to republish with
    prime r (7, 47, 61, 79) precisely "to avoid the existence of a sufficiently
    large intermediate field to perform SDA" (2019/1490 sec 5). So a prime r here
    is a designed defence, not an oversight -- and the same paper notes the fix is
    "very new and untested", and that a variant over special subsets of F_2^r
    rather than subfields might reach it anyway. Report the refusal below as
    "no intermediate subfield", never as "secure".

    Calibration against the paper's Table 4, run before this was trusted: the
    reduction reproduces the published system shapes on 4 of 6 rows exactly. Two
    rows (R2-IV's 259, R3-V's 131) are inconsistent with the paper's own formula
    and look like typos; the reduced square systems agree regardless. Costs land
    within 4-8 bits of the published log2 complexities, differing in both
    directions because this uses the estimator's current families (Crossbred, PXL)
    rather than the paper's XL-with-block-Wiedemann. Treat the family label as
    more reliable than the last bit of the exponent.
